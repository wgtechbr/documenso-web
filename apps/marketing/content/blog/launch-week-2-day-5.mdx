## Introducing Documenso Profile Links

Day 5 - The Finale ðŸ”¥

Signing documents has always been between humans, and signing something together should be as frictionless as possible. It should also be async, so you don't force your counterpart to jog to their device to send something when you are ready. Today we are announcing the new Documenso Profiles:

   Async > Sync: Add public templates to your Documenso Link and let people sign whenever they are ready.

Documenso profiles work with your existing templates. You can just add them to your public profile to let everyone with your link sign them. With profiles, we want to bring back the human aspect of signing.

By making profiles public, you can always access what your counterparty offers and make them more visible in the process. Long-term, we plan to add more to profiles to help you ensure the person you are dealing with is who they claim to be. Documenso wants to be the trust layer of the internet, and we want to start at the very fundamental level: The individual transaction.

Profiles are our first step towards bringing more trust into everything, simply by making the use of signing more frictionless. As there is more and more content of questionable origin out there, we want to support you in making it clear what you send out and what not.
